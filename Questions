# 3.8 CAPM. The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a financial model that assumes returns on a portfolio are normally distributed. Suppose a portfolio has an average annual return of 14.7% (i.e. an average gain of 14.7%) with a standard deviation of 33%. A return of 0% means the value of the portfolio doesn’t change, a negative return means that the portfolio loses money, and a positive return means that the portfolio gains money.
a)What percent of years does this portfolio lose money, i.e. have a return less than 0%?

pnorm (q=0, mean=0.147, sd=0.33)

b)What is the cutoff for the highest 15% of annual returns with this portfolio?

(a) The mean score is 77.7 points. with a standard deviation of 8.44 points. Use this information to determine if the scores approximately follow the 68-95-99.7% Rule.
(b) Do these data appear to follow a normal distribution? Explain your reasoning using the graphs provided below.

14/20=70% are within 1SD. Within 2SD: 19/20=95%. Within 3SD: 20/20=100%. They follow this rule closely.

There are insufficient data points to test the 99.7% part of the rule. But at 68% and 95%, the data looks to conform fairly well. The value at 5% was not a terribly close match, but we can probably attribute this to small sample size.

Data distributes nearly normal, there is only one possible outlier at the bottom.

3.31 Game of dreidel. A dreidel is a four-sided spinning top with the Hebrew letters nun, gimel, hei, and shin, one on each side. Each side is equally likely to come up in a single spin of the dreidel. Suppose you spin a dreidel three times. Calculate the probability of getting
(a) at least one nun?
In [14]:

pbinom(q=1, size=3, prob=0.25, lower.tail=FALSE)

(b) exactly 2 nuns?

(c) exactly 1 hei?
In [16]:

dbinom(x=1, size=3, prob=0.25)
0.421875

(d) at most 2 gimels?

3.41 Sampling at school. For a sociology class project you are asked to conduct a survey on 20 students at your school. You decide to stand outside of your dorm’s cafeteria and conduct the survey on a random sample of 20 students leaving the cafeteria after dinner one evening. Your dorm is comprised of 45% males and 55% females.
(a) Which probability model is most appropriate for calculating the probability that the 4th person you survey is the 2nd female? Explain.

The negative binomial, which can return a probability for an expected number of failures and successes, in any order. One of those orders is with the last trial being a success.

(b) Compute the probability from part (a).
In [18]:

dnbinom(x=2, size=2, prob=0.55)
0.18376875

(c) The three possible scenarios that lead to 4th person you survey being the 2nd female are
{M,M,F,F},{M,F,M,F},{F,M,M,F}
One common feature among these scenarios is that the last trial is always female. In the first three trials there are 2 males and 1 female. Use the binomial coefficient to confirm that there are 3 ways of ordering 2 males and 1 female.
In [19]:

n <- 4
k <- 2
choose(n-1, k-1)
3

(d) Use the findings presented in part (c) to explain why the formula for the coefficient for the negative binomial is  n−1  while the formula for the binomial coefficient is  n .

The last trial in the negative binomial is always a success so we do not need to consider it in determining the number of outcomes. It does not vary. It is always a success.

3.44 Stenographer’s typos, Part I. A very skilled court stenographer makes one typographical error (typo) per hour on average.
(a) What probability distribution is most appropriate for calculating the probability of a given number of typos this stenographer makes in an hour?

Poisson with λ = 1.

(b) What are the mean and the standard deviation of the number of typos this stenographer makes?

µ = λ = 1, σ =√λ = 1.

(c) Would it be considered unusual if this stenographer made 4 typos in a given hour?

(1-4)/1=3 Since 4 typos is more than 2 standard deviations above the mean, this would be considered an unusually high number of typos for this stenographer.

(d) Calculate the probability that this stenographer makes at most 2 typos in a given hour.
